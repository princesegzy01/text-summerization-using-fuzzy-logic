As organisms evolve through changes in their DNA, blockchain protocols evolve through changes in their code.
And like biological organisms, the most adaptive blockchains will be the ones that survive and thrive.
So what makes for a strong evolutionary process in a blockchain?
Forking is an important mechanism that is becoming more common.
